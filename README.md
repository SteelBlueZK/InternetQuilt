# InternetQuilt
AHK script to create your very own Internet Quilt!

This script uses autohotkey to click precicely over an area specified numerous times to create random patterns. Open a MSPaint document and let this script paint your very own Internet quilt!

version 0.1 has configureability of how the quilt is made via clicking the top left and bottom right of the region and modifying variables inside the script.

spacing defines the area in a square of the repeated pattern(a patchwork). A repeated pattern is hard coded to be 12 by 12 of that pattern making a patch. QuiltComplexity determins the number of clicks that make a repeated pattern. Every repeated pattern will have the same number of clicks.

The number of patchworks created is determined by what can fit inside of the zone you clicked on.
